在计算机科学中，trie，又称前缀树或字典樹，是一种有序树，用于保存关联数组，其中的键通常是字符串。

“Trie” is one of the most confusing names in CS. Edward Fredkin yanked it out of the middle of the word “retrieval”, which means it should be pronounced like “tree”. But, uh, there is already a pretty important data structure pronounced “tree” which tries are a special case of, so unless you never speak of these things out loud, no one can tell which one you’re talking about. Thus, people these days often pronounce it like “try” to avoid the headache.
